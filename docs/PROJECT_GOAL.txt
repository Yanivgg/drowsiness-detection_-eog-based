🎯 Project Goal

The project aims to detect microsleep events (brief moments of falling asleep) using EOG signals only.
Each event corresponds to a timestamp in which the subject pressed a button to indicate drowsiness.

We use the public Dryad dataset available here:
🔗 https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.5tb2rbp9c

📦 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of paired EDF recordings and annotation EDFs, organized as follows:

File	Duration (min)	Sampling rate	Channels	N_Annotations
01M_1.edf	121.75	128 Hz	7 (O1-Ref, O2-Ref, C3-Ref, C4-Ref, LOC-Ref, ROC-Ref, EKG)	0
01M_1_annotations.edf	0.42	—	—	26
...	...	...	...	...

✅ Summary CSV: dryad_eda_summary.csv
✅ Detailed annotations: annotations_summary.csv
📊 Total annotations extracted: 816

Each annotation marks a single timestamp (button press) indicating drowsiness onset.

All original files are located in:
original_data/

🧩 Task Definition

Our detection task:

Given continuous EOG signals, identify time windows that contain or are close to the annotated microsleep events.

We use only the EOG channels (LOC-Ref and ROC-Ref).

🧠 Reference Model

We base our implementation on the following open-source project:
🔗 https://github.com/alexander-malafeev/microsleep-detection

All cloned files are organized under the folder:
the_microsleep_project/

⚙️ Data Preprocessing (my codes/)

Inside the folder my codes/ are two main scripts:

EDA script — performs exploratory data analysis (summary, channel inspection, annotation counts).

Preprocessing script — prepares data for the model:

For each annotation, extracts a 2-second window (±1 s) around the event.

Performs resampling from 128 Hz → 200 Hz to match the original model input.

Converts signals to .mat files compatible with the original microsleep model.

Uses only the EOG channels (LOC-Ref, ROC-Ref).

Saved converted files under: data/

🧱 Model Preparation (microsleep_drayad/)

The folder microsleep_drayad/ contains:

Adapted functions from the original GitHub project for loading .mat data.

Your goal is to go through all the assignments and see that you understand what the task is and what I need to do. I really want to run most of their pipeline for me. Check if there are any glitches in the work done so far and suggest improvements if necessary or if not suggest a plan to continue.
